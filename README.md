Recipe Store is a website designed for the user to be able to create, read, update and delete their own recipes while browsing uploaded recipes from other users.

The general concept is for users to upload their 'tried and true' recipes to share with other users and visitors to the site who do not need a log in to see the recipes. 

Following discussions with my mentor, I decided use Mongo DB for database management for this project and deploy via Heroku.
