Our Recipe Store is a website designed for the user to be able to create, read, update and delete their own recipes while browsing uploaded recipes from other users.

The general concept is for users to upload their 'tried and true' recipes to share with other users and visitors to the site who do not need a log in to see the recipes. 

Following discussions with my mentor, I decided use Mongo DB for database management for this project and deploy via Heroku. 

The creation of the site, started with the basic set up of ideas as to what pages were required as a starting point.

The overall premise is simple - a website where users can look at recipes, and if they sign up can add, edit and delete their own recipes.

I started with setting up my core pages - the home page - simply titled Our Recipe Store, and then basic testing to ensure that the inital set up was correct before moving on to create more the complicated elements of the site. 

I used a bright colour very early on to see if my code was being read correctly. You can see an example of this at a later stage below:

Setting up the core components and keeping them as simple as possible meant I was soon ready to start creating login functionality and consider linking my database.

I kept things simple with naming, choosing recipes for my database name, reflecting the key focus on the site is the recipes themselves. As someone who is currently undertaking a cooking class myself, I regularly visit recipe sites for inspiration but rarely do I choose to set up a user name and even less frequently do I use the ones I do have. Consequently, while registered user experience is critical in the generation of more recipes, the site traffic is ikely to be driven by users who have not registered.
